MATRIZX

This is just a little project I'm working on mostly because I just wanted to show my math teacher a program about matrices.

The matrizx.h file is a C library to make operation with matrices. It has a simple matrix struct and some functions to create, copy and free matrices. It also provides a way to add, subtract, multiply and transpose matrices.

Please keep in mind that I'm not an expert programmer, far from that, I begun learning programming in the beggining of last year (2017), so some things might not be very good.

If you noticed anything wrong, please tell me.
